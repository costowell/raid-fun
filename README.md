# RAID Fun

I got [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by this paper, [The mathematics of RAID-6](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf), and now I want to implement it so its not just pixels on my screen.

I still have a lot to understand about Abstract Algebra, but I hope to learn a little more about Galois theory while making this.
